He achieved his dream to become the greatest ninja in his village, and now his face sits atop the Hokage monument. But this is not his story... A new generation of ninja are ready to take the stage, led by Naruto's own son, Boruto!\n<br><br>\nYears have passed since Naruto and Sasuke teamed up to defeat Kaguya, the progenitor of chakra and the greatest threat the ninja world has ever faced. Times are now peaceful and the new generation of shinobi has not experienced the same hardships as its parents. Perhaps that is why Boruto would rather play video games than train. However, one passion does burn deep in this ninja boy’s heart, and that is the desire to defeat his father!\n<br><br>\n(Source: VIZ Media)\n<br><br>\n<i>Note: Includes the one-shot \"Naruto: The Path Lit by the Full Moon\".</i>",

Constantly running errands and being beaten up by his classmates, Ippo has always dreamed of changing himself, but never has the passion to act upon it. One day, in the midst of yet another bullying, Ippo is saved by Takamura Mamoru, who happens to be a boxer. Ippo faints from his injuries and is brought to Takamura boxing gym to recover. As he regains consciousness, he is awed and amazed at his new surroundings in the gym, though lacks confidence to attempt anything. Takamura places a photo of Ippo&rsquo;s classmate on a punching bag and forces him to punch it. It is only then that Ippo feels something stir inside him and eventually asks Takamura to train him in boxing. Thinking that Ippo does not have what it takes, Takamura gives him a task deemed impossible and gives him a one week time limit. With a sudden desire to get stronger, for himself and his hard working mother, Ippo trains relentlessly to accomplish the task within the time limit. Thus Ippo&rsquo;s journey to the top of the boxing world begins.<br><br>\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)",

Massive beasts known as klaxosaurs, the planet’s new apex predators, have pushed mankind to the edge of extinction, and within the walls of the Plantations, things are no less dire. Humans no longer love or reproduce–adults live on in sterile immortality while children are regarded as nothing more than parasites, artificially created to pair up and pilot the Plantations’ giant defense robots known as Franxx. Former child whiz kid Hiro fails out of the piloting program after falling out of sync with his co-pilot, and a fateful decision to skip his group’s graduation ceremony puts him on a collision course with a horned girl known as Zero Two, whose co-pilots always end up dead. She claims Hiro as her “darling,” but what can that word even mean in such a loveless world?\n<br><br>\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",

The power of these arms vary, but they can stop normal bullets and deflect some others. The number of them differ with each diclinous, as does their full range. <br><br>\nThe tendency for violence among diclonii is high, especially as they grow older. As children, their violence stems from a certain playfulness, unlike the absolute hatred of humans in their later years. Diclonii are rare, as they are the members of their species that are able to reproduce naturally. <br><br>\nSilpelits are more common. They are the offspring of two humans, the male of which has been infected with the mutation. Interestingly, only males can pass on the genes, and all diclonii and silpelits turn out to be female. Certain scientists noticed an increasing number of babies with horns being born, along with those children murdering their own parents and others, and tried to contain the spreading and find out the cause by placing them in a Facility in cells where they are subject to inhumane experiments to test their abilities or where they await execution for being too dangerous. <br><br>\nThe main non-mutant character in the story is Kouta, who ends up becoming increasingly involved with one diclonius in particular, the main mutant character Lucy, the only pure diclonius, as she seeks a way to infect or kill all of humanity. Lucy has a cruel and unsettling past, and she has long since lost her empathy for humans, except for Kouta. <br><br>\nHowever, Director Kakuzawa, who has diclonius ancestry although he doesn't have the vectors, has plans to mate with Lucy and start a true diclonius race. If Lucy is found and he manages to do so, humanity will be nonexistent. <br><br>\nKouta and Lucy's lives have been intertwined since their childhood, but not necessarily in a good way. And after the virus is airborne and spread across all of Japan, what is the fate of humanity and who holds all of the answers? <br><br>\n<i>Note: Chapter count includes 6 extras.</i>",

In order to appease the wrath of the beast, the children decide to offer it a sacrifice: The unfortunate Arie, whom they believe to be the cause of the curse, is shoved into a well that leads to the Nijigahara tunnel—an act that in turns pushes Komatsuzaki, the budding thug who has carried a torch for Arie for a while already, entirely over the edge.\n<br><br>\nBut this is only the beginning of the complex, challenging, obliquely told Nijigahara Holograph, which takes place in two separate timelines and involves the suicidal Suzuki; Higure, his stalker-ish would-be girlfriend; their teacher Miss Sakaki, whose heavily bandaged face remains a mystery; and many more―brothers, sisters, parents, co-workers, teachers, aggressors and victims who are all inextricably linked to one another and all will eventually―ten years later―have to live with what they've done or suffered through.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Fantagraphics)\n<br><br>\n<i>Note: Includes three extra chapters.</i>",

Can we judge different moral codes? If a person is forced to betray their moral code, does that betrayal invalidate that moral code, and can the person still try to live up to that moral code?

With her gothic fashion, jet-black hair, and intense stare, Chihara is said to be a “landmine” girl or jirai-kei, the hyper-feminine, dark aesthetic often associated with yandere tendencies and unstable personalities. But when Kuroki accidentally draws Chihara’s attention, he discovers she isn’t nearly as unstable as people claim. Beneath the intimidating aura is a surprisingly sweet girl… if a little weird.\n<br><br>\nHesitantly, Kuroki begins to learn more about Chihara and her strange quirks. Is there more to her than her volatile reputation? Or is all the dark clothing just a red flag in disguise?\n<br><br>\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",

Everyone, that is, except Sheena, who wishes for nothing more than the growing conflict around her to end. On the night of her roommate's death, Sheena meets a strange girl covered in blood, who smiles despite the turmoil surrounding them. The next day, the girl appears as a new student in Sheena's class and introduces herself as Mimi. Initially thought to be a school myth, there are now whispers in the orphanage's halls that Mimi is their secret weapon—an immortal who cannot die. When Mimi is later assigned as Sheena's new roommate, Sheena's world grows even more complicated when she begins living with someone who loves and welcomes death, when all Sheena wants to do is stop it…\n<br><br>\n(Source: Kodansha USA)",

The series is often humorous in tone, but at the same time it involves very serious character development and especially in later episodes it becomes quite emotionally intense. Vash is occasionally joined by a priest, Nicholas D.

Mikagami is pale in the face of the coliseum, where the worst punishment is that \"the loser becomes the winner's slave and is mated\". The story depicts how he uses his weakest skill \"Copy\" with the confidence that he has never lost in a \"game\" before, and how he manages to defeat the stronger players in a duel as if it were a game.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Comic Natalie)",

    "description": "One day in the 21st century, a gate opened in the middle of the Ginza district of Tokyo. Out of the gate poured soldiers and strange creatures, and they soon made Ginza look like an image of hell. The gate apparently connected Japan to another world, a world with a militant empire and many supernatural creatures. The Japanese Self-Defense Force decided to send a small group, led by a soldier who's also an otaku, into the other world on a reconnaissance mission. They're meant to learn what they can about the empire (and its plans), the world, and the people.<br><br>\nThey're hardly in the world yet, though, when they come across a village destroyed by a giant fire-breathing dragon. The only survivor is an unconscious elven girl they find hidden in a well. Now they feel like they must warn the nearby towns about the dragon, and do what they can to help. On the way, they'll meet more magical, female companions, and learn more about this dangerous new world.\n",

But this time, the path to a new life isn’t quite so straight and narrow. Kenshirou Midou has loved cosmetics all his life, keeping his obsession secret from almost everyone except for his childhood friend Hiura Mihate. One day, Kenshirou gets permission to practice applying makeup on Hiura, and the results are earth-shattering: Hiura’s appearance transforms from a plain, undersized boy to a pretty, petite girl, and Kenshirou discovers just how freeing it is to apply his passion! Yet he’s not the only one who finds the process liberating. Hiura likes the makeup, and the subsequent “dress-up” in feminine clothes, and decides to start wearing the girls’ uniform to school. Kenshirou doesn’t understand if he’s unlocked something in Hiura, or if he’s simply seeing a new side to his childhood buddy that he never noticed before. What are these feelings bubbling between them now–is this attraction truly new?\n<br><br>\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)\n<br><br>\n<i>This series was originally self-published to Pixiv and was later serialized in Pixiv comicPOOL.</i><br><br>\n<i>Nominated for the Tsugimanga 2020 Award in the Web Manga Category.<i>",

The romance of the three kingdoms is an intriguing tale of heroic deeds, of alliance forged and broken, of loyalty and betrayal.<br>\nHong Kong artist Chan Mou retells this classic tale in \"The Ravages of Time\" from the perspective of the Sima clan, which in the end united the three kingdoms. Readers will be attracted by an array of well-developed characters and Chan Mou's own unique top-notch art-style.\n",

Eizo decides that he wants a slower life, one where he can live off the things he creates with his own hands. So, why not become a blacksmith? He does have one other stipulation: a cat companion for his quiet life. These requests are granted, and Eizo is whisked away to a new world and imbued with blacksmithing knowledge.

Shortly after, Fumi began dating a cool, attractive upperclassman who, coincidentally enough, had ties to Akira's current school, the prestigious Fujigaya Girls' Academy.<br><br>\n(Source: Lililicious; updated from an early misreading of the school name Fujigaya, called Fujigatani in initial translations of the first chapters)\n<br><br>\n<i>Note: Includes 10 extras chapters from the volumes.</i>",

It happens, sometimes you get isekai’d to the wrong place. But then it happens AGAIN! Someone ELSE summons me, I get ANOTHER superpower, and then I’m somewhere totally new. Repeat ad nauseam.
