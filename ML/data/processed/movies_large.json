      "embedding_text": "Five Feet Apart (2019). When life keeps you apart, fight for every inch. Seventeen-year-old Stella spends most of her time in the hospital as a cystic fibrosis patient. Her life is full of routines, boundaries and self-control — all of which get put to the test when she meets Will, an impossibly charming teen who has the same illness. There's an instant flirtation, though restrictions dictate that they must maintain a safe distance between them. As their connection intensifies, so does the temptation to throw the rules out the window and embrace that attraction. Genres: Romance, Drama. Keywords: forbidden love, terminal illness, hospital, best friend, falling in love, cystic fibrosis, star crossed lovers, first date, true love, teenager, dramatic, sentimental, romantic, melodramatic. Directed by Justin Baldoni.
